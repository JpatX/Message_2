    <p class="lead">I know you feel sad today. Whatever reason that makes you sad today, know that everything will pass through. 

You maybe going through a sad and difficult moment, but I want you to know that come what may, we are here for you, as your friend, offering our hand, our shoulder and trying to make you see all the good, honest things you can still find in this world. I want you to realize that the joy of living should be the most important thing, and that sorrows and setbacks are just temporary.

Your sadness will soon go away and you will be yourself again, a happy person, just like you have always deserved to be. </p>
